# Research

## Research Philosophy
Embracing John Tukey's perspective that "an approximate answer to the right problem is worth a good deal more than an exact answer to an approximate problem," my research aims to develop theoretical frameworks that not only provide deep insights but also demonstrate practical utility on large-scale datasets.
I focus on two core questions:
1) What embedded low-dimensional structures are present in data, and 
2) How can we exploit them algorithmically?
## Research Interests

### Core Areas
- **Theory**: Machine Learning Theory, High-Dimensional Statistics
- **Methodology**: Transfer Learning, Representation Learning, Multi-Task Learning, Manifold Learning, Low-Rank Approximation, Nonparametric Methods, Multi-Modal Data Integration, Hybrid Models
- **Applications**: Biomedical Data Analysis, Medical Image Processing, Genomics, Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning

### More Specific Research Interests

#### 1. Latent Structures in High-Dimensional Data
- Development of scalable algorithms for identifying and leveraging latent structures, particularly manifolds, to enhance dimensionality reduction and feature extraction
- Integration of data-driven nonparametric learning methods, including geometric multi-scale decomposition, for improved low-rank approximations of high-dimensional biomedical data

#### 2. Transfer Learning for Biomedical Applications
- Design and implementation of scalable, domain-informed transfer learning frameworks
- Exploitation of shared latent structures to enable robust generalization across diverse tasks
- Focus on practical applications in biomedical settings

#### 3. Hybrid Modeling for Interpretable Machine Learning
- Development of hybrid frameworks that combine structured models (e.g., survival models, epidemiological models) with modern machine learning approaches
- Enhancement of prediction accuracy while maintaining transparency in biostatistical applications
- Integration of domain knowledge with data-driven insights

### Broader Research Interests

#### Data Scarcity and Privacy-Aware Learning
- Development of domain-informed models incorporating biological insights
- Implementation of privacy-preserving techniques, including federated learning
- Focus on effective learning from limited and sensitive biomedical data

#### Multi-Modal Data Integration
- Exploration of transfer learning methods for integrating diverse data modalities
- Integration of genomics, imaging, and health records
- Discovery of actionable insights for improved predictions in biostatistical applications

#### Adaptive Learning for Dynamic Environments
- Creation of real-time adaptive learning frameworks
- Development of robust decision-making systems for biostatistics
- Handling of dynamic environments and heterogeneous populations
