Embracing John Tukey's perspective that "an approximate answer to the right problem is worth a good deal more than an exact answer to an approximate problem," my research aims to develop theoretical frameworks that not only provide deep insights but also demonstrate practical utility on large-scale datasets.
I focus on two core questions:
### 1 What embedded low-dimensional structures are present in data, and 
### 2 How can we exploit them algorithmically?
## Research Interests

### Core Areas
- **Theory**: Machine Learning Theory, High-Dimensional Statistics
- **Methodology**: Transfer Learning, Representation Learning, Multi-Task Learning, Manifold Learning, Low-Rank Approximation, Nonparametric Methods, Multi-Modal Data Integration, Hybrid Models
- **Applications**: Biomedical Data Analysis, Medical Image Processing, Genomics, Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning

### More Specific Research Interests

#### 1. Latent Structures in High-Dimensional Data
- Develop scalable algorithms that identify and utilize latent structures (e.g. Manifolds) to improve dimensionality reduction and feature extraction. 
- Incorporate Data-driven nonparametric learning methods, such as diffusion map, RKHS, to achieve better (low-rank) approximations of high-dimensional, large scale data.

#### 2. Transfer Learning for Biomedical Applications
- Develop scalable, domain-informed transfer learning frameworks that exploit shared latent structures, enabling robust generalization across diverse tasks.

#### 3. Hybrid Modeling for Interpretable Machine Learning
- Design hybrid frameworks combining structured models (e.g., survival models or epidemiological models) with machine learning to enhance prediction accuracy while maintaining transparency in biostatistical applications.

### Broader Research Interests

#### Data Scarcity and Privacy-Aware Learning
- Develop domain-informed models that integrate biological insights and leverage privacy-preserving techniques, like federated learning, to effectively learn from limited and sensitive biomedical data.

#### Multi-Modal Data Integration
- Explore methods (e.g. transfer learning) for integrating diverse data modalities, such as genomics, imaging, and health records, to uncover actionable insights and improve predictions in biostatistical applications.


#### Adaptive Learning for Dynamic Environments
- Create adaptive learning frameworks that update models in real-time to handle dynamic environments and heterogeneous populations, enabling robust decision-making in biostatistics.
