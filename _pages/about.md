Hello, I’m Aoran Chen, and my friends call me Thomas.  

I got my Bachelor’s degree in Mathematics from the University of Minnesota Twin Cities, where I was advised by Prof. Max Engelstein. I then earned my Master’s degree in Biostatistics at NYU GPH, advised by Prof. Yang Feng.  

I’m currently a research assistant at NYU GPH Feng Lab, working on topics in Machine Learning and High-Dimensional Statistics, and part of the SCALE Lab at Northwestern IEMS. I like thinking about math/stats/ML, and generally anything else that interests me. Lately, I’ve been listening to The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim OST a lot, and reading some notes on Galois Representations, modular forms, and Elliptic Curves (as a hobby).

Oh, and I have ADD—keeps things interesting.  


Interests

# Research Interests

I am primarily interested in machine learning problems that can benefit from mathematical and statistical tools. I like exploring the geometric structure of machine learning problems and how it shapes algorithms and theory.

Inspired by John Tukey’s remark:

> *“An approximate answer to the right problem is worth a good deal more than an exact answer to an approximate problem.”*

I focus on practical problems. My goal is to develop theories that not only provide deep insights but are also applicable to large-scale, real-world datasets.
