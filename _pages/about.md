Hello, I’m Aoran Chen; my friends call me Thomas.  

I got my Bachelor’s degree in Mathematics from the University of Minnesota Twin Cities, where I was advised by Prof. Max Engelstein. I then earned my Master’s degree in Biostatistics at NYU GPH, advised by Prof. Yang Feng.  

I’m currently a research assistant at NYU GPH Feng Lab, working on topics in Machine Learning and High-Dimensional Statistics, and part of the SCALE Lab at Northwestern IEMS (previously NYU Courant). I like thinking about math/stats/ML, and generally anything else that interests me. Lately, I’ve been listening to The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim OST a lot, and reading some notes on Galois Representations, modular forms, and Elliptic Curves (as a hobby).

Oh, and I have ADD—keeps things interesting.  


Interests
======
I am primarily interested in machine learning problems that can benefit from mathematical and statistical tools. I like exploring the geometric structure of machine learning problems and how it shapes algorithms and theory.

Inspired by John Tukey’s remark:

> *“An approximate answer to the right problem is worth a good deal more than an exact answer to an approximate problem.”*

I focus on practical problems. My goal is to develop theories that not only provide deep insights but are also applicable to large-scale, real-world datasets.

**Keywords**: Machine Learning, Statistical Learning Theory, Deep Learning Theory, Nonparametric Methods, High-Dimensional Statistics, Image Processing (Medical Images), Biomedical Data

More details in the Research section.

Miscellaneous
======
I sometimes blog/write about topics that catch my interest, like the geometry of physics—exploring the least action principle, path integrals, and variational approaches. I’ve also written about math concepts like p-adic modular forms and how tropical geometry ties into neural networks like ReLU. Recently, I’ve been working on reproducing GPT-2 from scratch, following Andrej Karpathy’s tutorials.

In my free time, I make music across genres, from fugues, waltz to dark synth and melodic dubstep. I also love modding games like Skyrim, Cyberpunk 2077, and Overwatch. Right now, I’m training in boxing; the goal is to compete in The Golden Gloves by 2026. 

When it comes to reading, my favorites are Hegel, Žižek, Merleau-Ponty, Deleuze, Lacan, Eros, etc. My last failed attempt was to work through Hegel’s *The Philosophy of History* and *Lectures on the History of Philosophy* at the same time.
