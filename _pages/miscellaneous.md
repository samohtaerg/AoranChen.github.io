## Jingle Bells Series
In 2021, the idea took hold: a new version of "Jingle Bells" every Christmas. The thought of creating something on Christmas Eve felt like a ritual against the year's monotony.

Each year, a new genre, tied to the moment's obsession. First, a Fugue. Then, Bossa Nova jazz. Last year, a Waltz. A tradition not just of music but of stepping into unfamiliar rhythms, beats, flows, and cultures. An annual promise: more to come.
